# Home lab.
---
## Information:
This page is like the main Home lab page for my projects in can also link to other repositories 
My own home lab git page a bit testing with automation (prefer Rocky Linux or Ubuntu).
it can contain the following:
- ansible playbooks.
- Bash scripts.
- Docker-compose yaml files.
- Attachments or configuration files depends.
- Applications.
- Kubernetes deployment information.
- Possible Raspberry pi 

Due to not having all the resources hardware wise I mainly prefer to do is virtual enviroments.
That means this is mainly for virtual machines and possible in the future.

## Goals to learn:
This may not be the git page of someone profesional or that has experience this page is for me to implement some of my ideas.
I think its good to use git for this so I can clone and re-allocate my scripts and ideas on multiple machines.
My main goal here is to learn and share what I learn even if someone else has already done such a thing its a good self learning option.
Here is a list of things I hope to learn or to get better in:
- Git.
- Writing better playbooks Ansible.
- Getting RHCSA 9 (EX200).
- Managing a working Kubernetes cluster.
- Scripting.
- Improving on CI/CD in general.
- Mastering Docker-compose.
- Automation.
- Possible projects with Raspberry PI and how to use sensors.
